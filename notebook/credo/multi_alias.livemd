# Rfx.Ops.Credo.MultiAlias

## Overview

This operation breaks out multi-alias lines (like `alias X.{A, B}`) so 
that each alias is on it's own line.

To get started, install the `rfx` dependency:

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:rfx, github: "andyl/rfx"}
])
```

Now we can give it a try:

```elixir
source = """
alias X.Y.{A, B, C}
"""

Rfx.Ops.Credo.MultiAlias.rfx_source(source)
```
